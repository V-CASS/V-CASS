            <div>
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: When doing voiceovers for videos, do you consciously pay attention to the emotional expression in your voice?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Of course. Unless it’s a more serious or objective scenario where we’re required to use a neutral, emotionless voice, most of the time, we’re expected to convey appropriate emotions, especially in contexts like films and animations.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: How do you determine the appropriate emotional tone to use?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Well, the client’s requirements always come first.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: If there are no explicit instructions from the client, and you have to decide on the emotional tone yourself, how do you figure out what’s appropriate?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Basiclly it will be decided on the content and theme of the video. You know, like the background story. But definitely I would not use the same tone all the time, so for different scenes, I adjust based on visual styles.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: How do you make these adjustments? Which visual elements influence your emotional expression? For example, lighting or color?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Yeah, the visuals themselves provide some hints. It's kind of like...a bright and sunny scene might prompt Interviewer to use a happier tone, while a dark and rainy scene might call for a sadder one.</p>
        
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: But, it’s not absolute. You still have to consider the theme and background. Take today, for example—although the weather is nice, if it were a breakup scene, I would still use a sad tone for the voiceover. Conversely, if it’s a joyful reunion happening on a rainy day, despite the gloomy visuals, I could use a more cheerful tone, don’t you think that would also make sense?</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: That sounds like the artistic technique of using a joyful setting to highlight sadness. But there are still some general rules, right? Certain visual elements or artistic conventions that often guide emotional expression?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Yes, exactly. It’s true that in most cases, the relationship between visuals and emotional expression doesn’t completely go against intuition. Only a few directors prefer to deliberately do the opposite.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Ok, let's suppose you’re a voiceover director, and you’re not considering the background story, theme, or the any personal artistic requirements, just focusing on the visuals. How would you guide a voice actor in matching the appropriate emotional tone to the visuals? I mean, using the most basic and common emotional correspondence between vision and hearing.</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: I typically start with lighting and color. These are the most immediate visual factors that can influence emotions. Brighter lighting and colors usually convey more positive emotions, while darker ones tend to evoke negative feelings.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Could you be more specific? For example, what kind of colors would you consider "bright," and which ones would feel heavier?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: If I had to set a standard, I'd say the key factors are brightness, saturation, and contrast. High brightness colors, like light yellow or pink, usually convey a light and cheerful feeling. On the other hand, low brightness colors, such as dark brown or gray, tend to evoke heavier or more oppressive emotions.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: So, saturation and contrast also affect emotional expression?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Yes, exactly. High saturation colors, like bright red, tend to intensify emotions—passion or anger, for example. Low saturation colors, like light blue or gray, convey softer, more restrained feelings, such as calmness or melancholy. As for contrast, strong contrasts, like black and white, often bring about a sense of tension and make the image more exciting. Meanwhile, softer transitions between colors tend to make emotions feel more relaxed and peaceful.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: What about lighting effects? Are there similar standards for judging how lighting affects emotions?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Yes, lighting plays a significant role. Soft lighting, like diffused light, creates a warm and comfortable atmosphere, often seen in peaceful or intimate scenes. In contrast, sharp lighting, such as a spotlight, can enhance tension or dramatize a scene. As for shadows, large areas of deep shadow, like in a basement or night scene, tend to convey feelings of oppression or fear, while softer shadows, like dappled light through trees, might evoke feelings of tranquility or mystery.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: These changes in color and lighting seem to be fairly obvious visual cues. But when you're doing voiceovers, do you also consider more subtle or less noticeable visual elements, like the shapes of lines or the composition of the scene?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Absolutely. Lines and composition are also crucial in determining the emotional tone. Smooth curves often convey elegance and softness, like in romantic or gentle scenes, while sharp, straight lines can suggest tension or conflict. For example, straight lines are more common in scenes involving action or architecture, where they can make the viewer feel uneasy or suggest danger.</p>
        
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: When it comes to composition, a balanced layout typically conveys stability and harmony, making the audience feel comfortable and at ease. However, when the composition is unbalanced—for instance, if one side has too many or too dense elements—it can create a sense of unease or even anxiety. In suspense or horror films, directors often use unbalanced compositions to heighten the tension and uncertainty for the audience.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: So, these combinations of visual elements—like color, lighting, lines, and composition—directly influence the emotional tone in voiceovers?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Yes, exactly. While some visual elements, like color and lighting, are more immediately noticeable, the finer details, such as lines and composition, also play a critical role in shaping emotional expression. Especially in more complex emotional scenes, these visual cues help voice actors accurately capture and convey emotions that align with the visuals, allowing the audience to more deeply connect with the emotional atmosphere of the story.</p>

            <h4>Selected Transcript of Interview 02</h4>
            <div>
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: First of all, the first question is whether you consciously pay attention to the emotional expression of the voice when dubbing videos, such as tone, intonation, volume, etc.</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Yes, because my main field of dubbing is promotional videos and some TV commercials. There are very few lip-syncing parts, and there are relatively few parts that are not related to the characters. Basically, if the client sends a rough copy, we may send it as a reference, and then we will look at that reference and try to match the director's desired feeling for dubbing.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Ok. When your director asks you to use some emotional voice, they usually propose based on what standards. For example, they may say that this scene has some purpose, so I hope you can use emotions such as happiness or sadness to dub. Will they have such communication?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Basically, we are in contact. If it's not the direct director, but the video producer in the middle, he may directly give you a script and roughly tell you how it feels here. He won't tell you the general idea, and then you will see the image of that character or their video screenshots on his script, or some directors will directly send samples of their videos. You know, he hasn't finished the film yet, but he will send you the one without subtitles to show you the general feeling, and then show you what his music looks like. Then I will just feel my own feeling to match it.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Assuming we first exclude the requirements of Party A and the limitations of the subject matter, and simply say there is a video scene, and you want to dub it, how do you do it? Simply rely on the content of this video scene to grasp the emotion of the voice, such as the characteristics of the picture or some commonly used artistic techniques. Can it directly imply or guide the emotional emotion of a voice?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Okay, sometimes we post some manuscripts in the group, but they don't have any visuals at all. If there are visuals, they can better grasp it. But if there are only manuscripts, I just use their description. When we dub, because I have been doing it for a long time. When I see the text, I roughly know which direction they lean towards, and I can immediately give them that feeling.
                    Ok, I may give more options and then let him choose.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Is there a situation where you rely on the visuals to grasp emotions? Assuming you are a dubbing director, and we don't consider the specific story background, director's or client's requirements, we only focus on the visuals. How do you guide a dubbing actor to match the appropriate dubbing emotions for this scene? If only the picture matters.</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: It depends on what kind of picture it is. For example, if it is a picture of him decorating with lights during the Spring Festival, then I roughly know that he is emotionally positive and has a lively and positive voice. If he has a blue sea and a gloomy feeling, then he should walk in an emo style. You need to use more breath and voice that combines reality and virtuality, and not be so realistic.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: OK, so what you just mentioned can be abstracted as the Spring Festival. That can be abstracted as the scene and its atmosphere, and the pictures of the Spring Festival are usually red or brighter. Then this can be abstracted as color or light and shadow. And you just mentioned that the blue sea may symbolize more of a melancholy. Can this also be considered? Some influences of color and tone, or images like the sea, are there any rules for association like this? Can you share them?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: You mean if it's about dubbing, when I see the picture, I would probably just do the dubbing. The thing about dubbing and actors is a bit like dubbing. Everything about it is a bit like painting. Everything about it is presented in the mind. When you see the text or the picture, if the director only gives those things, you have to have enough imagination.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: How can you associate melancholy with the blue sea?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Because. I've probably watched a lot of these kinds of movies, and they're all in the same style. When I see blue, I think of these things, and if I see some colorful ones, it might be some runway shows or some of those things. For lively advertisements, coffee colors, I think of chocolate Dove and so on. And Starbucks? Maybe they have a lot of advertisements, okay okay. There may be an experience, to be honest. If you're a complete novice in this industry, you won't have any visuals.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Maybe besides color, I think what was mentioned earlier was more about color. Besides color, are there any other things that might be noticed?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: There are many colors on the screen. You can see that it's not just about colors. For example, in the opening scene, if it's a sea forest, then if it's an airport, usually an airport or something like that. If it's a high-rise building, you will know that it's definitely a promotional video. It's definitely going to describe a certain city. Otherwise, it's like aerial photography of China or A Bite of China. It starts with a city first. The screen starts with a certain kind of character, such as sugar-coated haws or handicrafts, rarely or the back of an old person. You will know that this is a heartwarming narrative film. It may be telling the story of this person, or it may be talking about some intangible cultural heritage. Okay, then if it's like this.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Ok, then the next small step is that I have prepared some videos, and the teacher can roughly infer what kind of emotions would be better for dubbing the video. You can tell me why you think so, for example, the first one.
                    From which visual elements can you associate what appropriate emotions should be used?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: It belongs to a kind of comparison. Positive and sunny, with a bit of artistry. Artistry is not very detached, just a bit artistic, that's it.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: What is the feeling of positivity and sunshine? How did you get it and why do you think so?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Because it has sunshine, you can see that the sky is very blue, with blue sky and white clouds, and there is a tree green representing vitality, and then add what is it called? Is that a windmill?
                    Bookmarks and such, you will feel that it is a kind of lively composition.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Okay, then the next video.</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: He might be something, for example. How many years have you been in love with him? Otherwise? You can also live well alone, the kind that starts with something.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Is this feeling also derived from the background and color?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: I don't think his style is very strong. I think he is the kind of person who is relatively gentle at the beginning. A monologue of a state of mind.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Can I abstractly understand that the change in its picture is not very strong?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: I don't feel it now. Is there a strong possibility that it will happen later? But for now, I feel that it is relatively calm, that is, the rhythm of the picture.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: OK, next video.</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Campus memories.
                    His emotions are fragments of memories.
                    Otherwise, what kind of campus bullying?</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Then why do you think he is a school bully?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: The railing basket is too bad.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Ok ok, can this be understood as a kind of imagery expression of objects in the picture? Are there any other things, such as light and shadow, that can be seen?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Because it's very dark. Then I think he was actually sunny at this time, like noon, but he wanted to darken the color tone. So he was bullied. If it weren't for memories</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: So basiclly, it shows a negative tendency?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Yeah, I think so.</p>

            <h4>Selected Transcript of Interview 03</h4>
            <div>
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: First of all, I mainly want to know if you consciously pay attention to the emotional expression of your voice when dubbing videos, such as your tone, pitch or volume, or speed of speech, etc.
                    Especially, experiences like narration in advertisements and promotional videos?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: I gave some promotional videos, like the Macau Women's Federation for its 75th or 70th anniversary in 2024.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: So when you are editing these promotional videos, especially with the narration, how do you judge what kind of emotion you should use to match a certain sentence?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: They usually just send the one with BGM directly, and then the rhythm of his BGM will first prompt you</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Ok, generally speaking, the production team will have pre-set requirements, and then the director will have requirements, like this, right?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Generally, it depends on your understanding of the text, and then based on the ups and downs and characteristics of the BGM, you can capture the emotion at that time. Because listening to background music is really useful, because music can really remind you of that section.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Assuming you are given a silent scene without any director's requirements, and it is purely up to you to express yourself, how would you describe the content of this scene with appropriate tone and emotion?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: With the narration, yes. Look at the words.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: If we set aside the semantic content of the word itself and assume that we only have one, then let's say you want to describe it vividly to a friend. The image of a video, whether it's the word or the requirement, is not there. You only have this image to refer to. How do you determine what tone is more appropriate? Would you first pay attention to the style of the content of the video itself?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Yes, I will first pay attention to what theme this is.
                    For example, it is a commercial advertisement or an introduction to gameplay guide. For example, there are different types of New Year guides and different tones, and the subject matter is limited.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Can I understand it this way? The reason why different themes have different appropriate emotions is that different themes often have relatively independent visual styles, such as the Chinese New Year promotional video. Maybe it's all about red lanterns and very cheerful scenes. If it's a heavy disaster documentary, the overall picture may be relatively dark. Then there are many slow shots or... Can I understand that the visual style is often different under different themes?
                    Think back to the movies you have come into contact with in the past, whether they are the ones you have dubbed or the ones you have watched. Different types of movies and their visuals. When expressing different emotions, you may use different techniques. Conversely, how do you relate your dubbing to emotions?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Some have this connection. First of all, if the brightness and purity of the color are high, it will definitely be cheerful. Then, the faster the switching speed of its picture, the faster the rhythm you may need to follow. If the picture is one frame, like a slide show stacked on top of each other, like a montage, then of course the sound will be softer and heavier. It will be heavier. If it is a cheerful one, like a zoo, it will naturally introduce some animals more cheerfully.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Ok ok then. What you just thought of can be roughly summarized as the properties of color itself, the speed of image or lens switching, and the stability of image dynamics. These are the three main points. In addition, are there any other associative elements you can think of?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: It depends on what appears in the picture. What is the subject of the picture? If it is a still life or a very dynamic thing, it is different. It can make you think of everything. The same type of film that you can imagine, such as McDonald's, even if its camera switching is very slow, it is a burger that pops slowly, but you must also have the kind of passionate emotion like KFC. Therefore, it is the same type of film that can guide you and make you imagine. You can use this kind of experience because it is all based on experience. It is all the way opened by predecessors.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: We can directly use a few videos to try it out. For example, if you want to guess what kind of emotions and tone you should use based on the visual elements in these videos, how would you choose?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: It must be soothing.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Why is it soothing? From which parts of the picture is this feeling derived or associated?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Because its rhythm is slow and the colors are relatively soothing, giving people a fresh feeling, they hope that others can pay more attention to this aspect. When using sound, they also hope that it has a clear and transparent feeling, this summer.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: What do you think? The emotional expression of sound is assuming that there is a person who does not look at the picture, but only listens to your description to imagine the picture. Do you think a voice that expresses emotions more closely to the picture can help the listener understand the picture and imagine it more realistically and realistically?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Definitely necessary, definitely necessary, because sound serves the picture, if it is dubbing for the picture.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Ok ok, then let's watch this video.</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: This video may be associated with something more patriotic or lonely, because it is a ship. A ship sailing on an endless sea may make people think of the sea of growth, the confusion of life, the darker tone, and some documentary or growth-related factors.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Okay, so you just mentioned a boat, a small boat sailing on the boundless sea. Can this be considered as some visual characteristics in terms of layout or composition?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Yes, it could be like this.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Ok ok. Let's take another look at this. Setting aside the subject matter and context, it's simply describing it to a friend who can't see the picture.</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Simply describing for those who cannot see the picture. Sense of era. Sense of era.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: How would you handle your feelings in terms of tone?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: It has a sense of age. There may be a feeling of storytelling, as if everyone likes to talk about the kind of storytelling that happened a long time ago, hoping that he can capture the other person's feelings at the first time, because he looks like the opening of something.
                    Relatively soothing.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Where does the soothing feeling come from?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Because its camera speed is not fast, this thing is both a close-up and a close-up shot.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: It can also be understood as the dynamic of the picture and the distance of the lens.</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: If he has a close-up of something, then his current attention is definitely hoping that you will focus on such an object at that time. Others have already hoped that you will focus on this aspect. You cannot use a large amount of text or information to quickly shift others' attention, which is contrary to the picture.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Take another look at this video.</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Possibly. The restlessness of youth.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Why?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Although it is also a close-up, it moves very fast with wind. It may be a feeling of youthful restlessness, chaos in the heart, or a long monologue.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: It seems that its overall color tone is not very bright.</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: It's not very bright. Who would be particularly bright and colorful when they were young or in puberty?</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: So what about this video?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: This person. In the midst of luxury, he may be particularly panicked?</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: How do you feel this rather panicked emotion?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Because his camera is shaking too much. Too fast, the whole subject is in a virtual lens, there is nothing special about it, just like you are carrying a camera and running, there is no special point of focus, then it is very uncertain.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: What about this video?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Maybe it's loneliness! Loneliness.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: What is the source of this emotion?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Because he plays basketball, what is this thing called, a basketball pit? This rope is also broken, and things that feel broken and broken are very broken. It stands in the center of the main body of the picture.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: You just mentioned a subject and the relationship between the position of the picture quite frequently. For example, when the picture is relatively balanced, what kind of emotion is there? And when the center of gravity of the picture, such as being particularly close to a certain corner, is also very unbalanced as a whole, what emotion might be associated with it?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: The subject and composition ratio of such a picture are important factors for you to perceive the message conveyed to you by the current picture. Please refer to it.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: For example, if the entire subject is located in the middle, and this record is also included, can we consider them as relatively stable? As for this small boat, it is the center of gravity, which is actually quite biased. If we compare this small boat with this windmill, will it be a small boat? The negative tendency will be stronger, and the positive tendency of the windmill will be stronger. Is it possible?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: There is a big difference between the distant view and the close-up view. The distant view gives you a broad-minded feeling, which allows you to imagine and gives you more room to imagine. However, the close-up view is directly pulled in front of you, and your entire attention and center of gravity are almost irresistible. The feeling of irresistibility is irresistible.</p>
