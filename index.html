            <h4>2.3 Expert Interview Methodology</h4>
            <p>The interviews followed a <strong>semi-structured</strong> format. Core questions addressed the relationship between visual cues and emotional expression, but the format allowed flexibility for deeper exploration. This method helped uncover implicit knowledge regarding how voice actors adapt emotional tones based on visual content.</p>
            <h4>2.3.1 Core Questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>When doing voiceovers for videos, do you consciously pay attention to the emotional expression in your voice? And how do you determine the appropriate emotional tone to use?</li>
                <li>What visual elements influence your choice of emotional expression when doing voiceovers? Are there any general rules or patterns that can guide a voice actor in selecting the appropriate emotional expression based on different visual cues?</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>2.3.2 Interview Transcript</h4>
            <div>
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: When doing voiceovers for videos, do you consciously pay attention to the emotional expression in your voice?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Of course. Unless it’s a more serious or objective scenario where we’re required to use a neutral, emotionless voice, most of the time, we’re expected to convey appropriate emotions, especially in contexts like films and animations.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: How do you determine the appropriate emotional tone to use?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Well, the client’s requirements always come first.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: If there are no explicit instructions from the client, and you have to decide on the emotional tone yourself, how do you figure out what’s appropriate?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Basiclly it will be decided on the content and theme of the video. You know, like the background story. But definitely I would not use the same tone all the time, so for different scenes, I adjust based on visual styles.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: How do you make these adjustments? Which visual elements influence your emotional expression? For example, lighting or color?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Yeah, the visuals themselves provide some hints. It's kind of like...a bright and sunny scene might prompt Interviewer to use a happier tone, while a dark and rainy scene might call for a sadder one.</p>
        
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: But, it’s not absolute. You still have to consider the theme and background. Take today, for example—although the weather is nice, if it were a breakup scene, I would still use a sad tone for the voiceover. Conversely, if it’s a joyful reunion happening on a rainy day, despite the gloomy visuals, I could use a more cheerful tone, don’t you think that would also make sense?</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: That sounds like the artistic technique of using a joyful setting to highlight sadness. But there are still some general rules, right? Certain visual elements or artistic conventions that often guide emotional expression?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Yes, exactly. It’s true that in most cases, the relationship between visuals and emotional expression doesn’t completely go against intuition. Only a few directors prefer to deliberately do the opposite.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Ok, let's suppose you’re a voiceover director, and you’re not considering the background story, theme, or the any personal artistic requirements, just focusing on the visuals. How would you guide a voice actor in matching the appropriate emotional tone to the visuals? I mean, using the most basic and common emotional correspondence between vision and hearing.</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: I typically start with lighting and color. These are the most immediate visual factors that can influence emotions. Brighter lighting and colors usually convey more positive emotions, while darker ones tend to evoke negative feelings.</p>

                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Could you be more specific? For example, what kind of colors would you consider "bright," and which ones would feel heavier?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: If I had to set a standard, I'd say the key factors are brightness, saturation, and contrast. High brightness colors, like light yellow or pink, usually convey a light and cheerful feeling. On the other hand, low brightness colors, such as dark brown or gray, tend to evoke heavier or more oppressive emotions.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: So, saturation and contrast also affect emotional expression?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Yes, exactly. High saturation colors, like bright red, tend to intensify emotions—passion or anger, for example. Low saturation colors, like light blue or gray, convey softer, more restrained feelings, such as calmness or melancholy. As for contrast, strong contrasts, like black and white, often bring about a sense of tension and make the image more exciting. Meanwhile, softer transitions between colors tend to make emotions feel more relaxed and peaceful.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: What about lighting effects? Are there similar standards for judging how lighting affects emotions?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Yes, lighting plays a significant role. Soft lighting, like diffused light, creates a warm and comfortable atmosphere, often seen in peaceful or intimate scenes. In contrast, sharp lighting, such as a spotlight, can enhance tension or dramatize a scene. As for shadows, large areas of deep shadow, like in a basement or night scene, tend to convey feelings of oppression or fear, while softer shadows, like dappled light through trees, might evoke feelings of tranquility or mystery.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: These changes in color and lighting seem to be fairly obvious visual cues. But when you're doing voiceovers, do you also consider more subtle or less noticeable visual elements, like the shapes of lines or the composition of the scene?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Absolutely. Lines and composition are also crucial in determining the emotional tone. Smooth curves often convey elegance and softness, like in romantic or gentle scenes, while sharp, straight lines can suggest tension or conflict. For example, straight lines are more common in scenes involving action or architecture, where they can make the viewer feel uneasy or suggest danger.</p>
        
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: When it comes to composition, a balanced layout typically conveys stability and harmony, making the audience feel comfortable and at ease. However, when the composition is unbalanced—for instance, if one side has too many or too dense elements—it can create a sense of unease or even anxiety. In suspense or horror films, directors often use unbalanced compositions to heighten the tension and uncertainty for the audience.</p>
        
                <p class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: So, these combinations of visual elements—like color, lighting, lines, and composition—directly influence the emotional tone in voiceovers?</p>
                <p class="expert"><strong>Expert</strong>: Yes, exactly. While some visual elements, like color and lighting, are more immediately noticeable, the finer details, such as lines and composition, also play a critical role in shaping emotional expression. Especially in more complex emotional scenes, these visual cues help voice actors accurately capture and convey emotions that align with the visuals, allowing the audience to more deeply connect with the emotional atmosphere of the story.</p>

            <!-- <h4>Guidelines for Matching Visual Elements with Emotional Expressions</h4>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lines and Shapes:</strong> Smooth, flowing lines often convey elegance and calmness, while sharp lines may suggest tension or conflict.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light and Shadow:</strong> Bright highlights can symbolize hope, while shadows can evoke mystery or fear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Composition and Balance:</strong> Symmetrical compositions convey stability, whereas imbalance may suggest unease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Color:</strong> Bright colors are often associated with happiness, while darker tones may evoke sadness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Objects and Scenes:</strong> Certain objects, like roses, symbolize love, while wilted plants might suggest decay or loss.</li>

                <p>In order to extract detailed, objective information from each keyframe without introducing any emotional bias, we designed a specialized prompt for the Vision-Language Model (VLM). This prompt is tailored to capture the visual content and style of the image in a highly neutral and descriptive manner.</p>
                <p>The VLM is instructed to focus solely on the factual details of the image, ensuring that the description remains purely informational. By avoiding any emotional language or interpretive keywords, the prompt ensures that the output provides an accurate visual summary that can later be processed for emotional inference in subsequent stages.</p>
                <p>The key elements of the prompt are:</p>
                <p><strong>Comprehensive Detail: </strong>The VLM is asked to describe the keyframe in as much detail as possible, focusing on both content (objects, people, background elements) and stylistic attributes (colors, lighting, shapes).</p>
                <p><strong>Objectivity: </strong>The prompt explicitly avoids any emotional or subjective language, ensuring that the output remains neutral and strictly descriptive.</p>
                <p><strong>Neutral Style: </strong>The VLM's output must avoid keywords or phrases that could imply an emotional interpretation, such as "calm" or "tense." This allows for an unbiased description of the visual content, which can then be further analyzed for emotional alignment in the speech synthesis stage.</p>

                <p><strong>Task Description</strong></p>
                <p>The primary task involves analyzing keyframe visual contexts to extract emotional and content information. This information is then translated into expressive speech synthesis instructions that align semantically and emotionally with the visual content. The goal is to enhance user understanding and engagement through the integration of para-linguistic cues in speech.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Expert Knowledge Utilization</strong></p>
                <p>Expert knowledge in visual analysis is applied to guide emotional inference. This includes the analysis of lines, shapes, light and shadow, color psychology, and object symbolism. For instance, soft curves and warm lighting might evoke calm, while sharp lines and dark shadows can suggest tension or unease. This expert-driven process is vital for accurately interpreting the visual content's emotional tone.</p>
    
                <p><strong>Workflow Explanation</strong></p>
                <div>
                    <p><strong>1: Visual Content Analysis: </strong>Analyze visual elements, such as shapes, colors, and lines, using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to extract relevant features that inform the emotional and contextual interpretation.</p>
                    <p><strong>2: Emotional Inference: </strong>Using the expert knowledge and the extracted visual cues, infer the emotional content of the video. This step includes mapping specific visual cues (e.g., lighting, composition) to likely emotional responses.</p>
                    <p><strong>3: Instruction Generation: </strong> Translate the emotional and content information into specific speech synthesis instructions, including tone, mood, volume, and speech rate. These instructions guide the synthesis of context-aware expressive speech.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Workflow Examples</strong></p>
                <div>
                    <p>Example 1: A video with soft curves and warm colors might generate a calm, warm-toned female voice to describe a serene landscape scene.</p>
                    <p>Example 2: Sharp lines and high-contrast colors might result in a tense, assertive male voice, aligned with the visual content's emotional intensity.</p>

        <h4>5. Appendix of Case Studies on BLVs</h4>
        <!-- <div>We built objective survey and interview with BLV participants...</div> -->

        <div>
            <h4>5.1 Observation Purpose</h4>
            <p>
                This observation aims to explore how emotion-based speech, driven by visual content, can improve the video-watching experience for BLV (Blind and Visually Impaired) users. While many BLV users have grown accustomed to the neutral tone of AI voices, this study introduces emotional narration to create a more immersive and engaging experience, helping them better perceive emotions and imagine visual scenes.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>5.2 Observation Process and Methodology</h4>
            <p>
                The analysis relies on subjective feedback from BLV users. Through interviews, we collected personal opinions on how different types of narration influenced their emotional engagement and overall experience. Despite being familiar with standard AI narration, participants were surprised by the emotional depth that emotion-driven speech brought to their experience.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Participants:</strong> BLV users from various backgrounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Observation Design:</strong> Two sets of videos were shown—one with neutral AI speech and one with emotion-driven speech tailored to visual cues (e.g., lighting, character emotions).</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Collection:</strong> We conducted detailed interviews to gather user opinions on the emotional impact of the videos and their ability to visualize the content.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>5.3 Key Findings</h4>
            <p>
                The interviews revealed some key insights:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>While many BLV users were accustomed to AI voices, they <strong>expressed surprise and delight at the emotional nuances</strong> that emotion-based narration provided. Participants noted that the emotional speech made the content feel more alive and engaging, almost as if a real person were speaking to them.</li>
                <li>Some participants indicated that they typically avoid watching videos with no narration or explanation, as they are unable to fully grasp the visual content. The emotion-driven narration <strong>helped bridge this gap</strong>, allowing them to better visualize scenes and understand the emotions conveyed through the visuals.</li>
                <li>The participants appreciated how emotion-based speech helped them feel more immersed in the story, with better clarity in understanding characters' emotions and the mood of the scenes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h4>5.4 Interview Case Studies</h4>
            <p>
                The following examples illustrate how emotion-based speech influenced user experience, drawn from our interviews with participants:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Case 1: Participant A</strong>  
                    “In the second group of videos, the emotional tone made a big difference. I could feel the sadness of the characters, and it felt as if I were right there in the scene. It was much easier to connect with the emotions.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Case 2: Participant B</strong>  
                    “I’m used to AI voices, but the emotional narration felt like a real person was speaking to me. It made the story come alive, and I was much more engaged with the video.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Case 3: Participant C</strong>  
                    “When I watch short videos, I usually skip the ones with only visuals and no explanation, as I can’t follow the content. The second group's narration made it easier to imagine what was happening, and I could better understand the scene’s emotions.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Case 4: Participant D</strong>  
                    “Normally, AI voices are monotone, and I’m used to that. But when the voice changed with the scene, I could better understand the emotions, like fear or excitement. It made a huge difference in how I perceived the video.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Case 5: Participant E</strong>  
                    “The emotional narration felt more like a person speaking, and I could imagine the characters’ expressions and actions better. It really helped me immerse myself in the story.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Case 6: Participant F</strong>  
                    “Although I usually speed through AI narrations, the emotional version made me slow down and really listen. It felt more dynamic and alive, which made the whole experience more enjoyable.”
                </li>
